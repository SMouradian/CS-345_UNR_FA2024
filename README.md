# CS 345 - Fall 2024 Course at the University of Nevada, Reno

## Created by Samuel Mouradian - 4th Year CSE Major

### Final Project Details:
There are three files within this final project:
1. helpers.py
2. multiclass_classification.py
3. Performance Evaluation.pdf

The "helpers.py" file is a collection of 3 functions that will load a file into a Panda Dataframe, which will then be cleaned, and finally separated into testing and training portions.

The "multiclass_classification.py" file will have python code performing direct - and hierarchical - multi-class classification. There will also be a series of new functions that will be implemented:
- One will take a model and training data to form a tr ained model.
- Another will evaluate the model using the test data, and will then produce an accuracy value.
- The third implemented function will sample the data.
- The last two will, respectively, return the train and test dataframes, as well as convert "df" into a binary dataset and return it.

The "Performance Evaluation.pdf" file will encapsulate the testing accuracies for tall the classification methods done in the "multiclass_classification.py" file. The results will be printed in this file with photo evidence that the code executed successfully.
